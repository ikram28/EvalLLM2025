# EvalLLM2025 - Biomedical Named Entity Recognition

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for the [EvalLLM 2025]([link-to-challenge](https://evalllm2025.sciencesconf.org/)) challenge, focusing on biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and health event extraction tasks.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

The EvalLLM 2025 challenge consists of two main tasks:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying 21 types of biomedical entities
- **Health Event Extraction**: Extracting health-related events from biomedical texts
